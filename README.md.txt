In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey here and the survey for the DETE here.

In this project, we'll play the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:

Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees

In this guided project, we experienced that in order to extract any meaningful insights from our data, we had to perform many data cleaning tasks. In order to create one visualization (and not even the final one), we completed the following tasks:

Explored the data and figured out how to prepare it for analysis
Corrected some of the missing values
Dropped any data not needed for our analysis
Renamed our columns
Verified the quality of our data
Created a new institute_service column
Cleaned the Contributing Factors columns
Created a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
Combined the data
Cleaned the institute_service column
Handled the missing values in the dissatisfied column
Aggregated the data
